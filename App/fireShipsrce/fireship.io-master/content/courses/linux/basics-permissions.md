## Show File Permissions

Use the `-l` flag to show file permissions:

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
ls -l
```

## Change File Permissions

Add write access to a group

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
chmod g+w somefile.txt
```

Remove write access to a group:

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
chmod g-w somefile.txt
```


Add a specific file permission config, like readonly:

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
chmod g=r somefile.txt
```


Update file permissions with octal notation: 

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
chmod 644 somefile.txt
```

Check out the [chmod calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/) to configure specific file permissions settings easily.
