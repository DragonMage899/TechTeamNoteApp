## Managing Processes in Linux

List current processes:

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
ps

ps -ef
```

Kill a process:

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
kill PID # SIGTERM
kill -9 PID # SIGKILL
```

Use htop for a fully interactive process management experience: 

{{< file "cog" "command line" >}}
```bash
htop
```
